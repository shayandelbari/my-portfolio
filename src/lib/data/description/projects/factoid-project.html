<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Hi there! üëã</p>
<p>This is a C# project we created for <strong>LaSalle College</strong>. The goal is to process text provided by the user and answer questions based on a specific template. Factoid questions are closed-ended questions that start with words like "Who," "When," "Where," "How many," or "How much."</p>

<h2>What You‚Äôll Find</h2>
<ul>
  <li>üìÑ <strong>Docs and Guidelines</strong>: Everything you need to understand the project is in the <a href="docs/">docs</a> folder.</li>
  <li>‚öôÔ∏è <strong>A Unique Challenge</strong>: We weren‚Äôt allowed to use certain built-in functions or data structures, so you might spot some extra steps in the code. We got creative to work around those limitations and made it all come together!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>To set up and run the project, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Clone the repository:</p>

  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Update</strong>: Changes the reference text.</li>
  <li><strong>Explain</strong>: Provides a short explanation of the types of questions you can ask.</li>
